# Week 4: Extending a Standard SAP Fiori App 
We are starting the week by preparing the backend system ES5 playing the role of your on-prem SAP system. In the following exercises we will first act as a key user adapting a standard app for many end users using visual tools. Then, as a developer, we will create an adaptation project to adapt a standard application with code-based extensions.
