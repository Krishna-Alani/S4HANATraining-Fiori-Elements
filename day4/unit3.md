![Trial Home > Home - SAP BTP Cockpit - [InPrivate] - Microsoft​ Edge](images/unit3/req2.png "Trial Home > Home - SAP BTP Cockpit - [InPrivate] - Microsoft​ Edge")

This is the summarized list for you, the developer, with the changes to implement:

1. Remove the options button
2. Change the column title from Category to Type
3. Enlarge the product image in the single object view.
4. Add additional button called Share by Email, which should be able to generate email containing info about products
   that have been selected by the end-user from the table.

In this unit you will learn how to do the first three changes, which are basic UI changes. In the next unit you will
learn how to do the fourth change, which is advanced extension.

   ![demospace - SAP Business Application Studio and 1 more page - [InPrivate] - Microsoft​ Edge](images/unit3/img_008.png "demospace - SAP Business Application Studio and 1 more page - [InPrivate] - Microsoft​ Edge")

   ![demospace - SAP Business Application Studio and 1 more page - [InPrivate] - Microsoft​ Edge](images/unit3/img_009.png "demospace - SAP Business Application Studio and 1 more page - [InPrivate] - Microsoft​ Edge")

### Step 3: Launch the SAPUI5 Visual Editor for the newly created Adaptation Project

1. After the generation of the project has finished, the whole page might refresh itself to set the current workspace
   SAP Business application studio to the one of the newly created project. After the browser loads successfully, expand
   the webapp folder and right\-click  **manifest.appdescr\_variant**  file.

   > ⚠️ Have in mind that if, while opening SAPUI5 Visual Editor, it is failing to open with 403 error, this is most probably because you have too many exposed ports in SAP Business Application Studio and you should unexpose one, so that the SAPUI5 Visual Editor can expose one for itself. Just go to View/Find command, type 'Ports: Preview' and if the count of the ports shown is 5, than type again Ports: Unexpose and select on of the ports to unexpose it. Just do not unexpose the one that is named 'Theia hosted instance', if there is such. Then you can launch again the SAPUI5 Visual Editor and it will load successfully this time. You need this procedure only if you have the 403 error while trying to load the editor, and it needs to be done just once, before the first launch ot the SAPUI5 Visual Editor for the used devspace.
